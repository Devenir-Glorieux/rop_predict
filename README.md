# rop_predict
Predicting the rate of penetration during well drilling. The first step in creating a recommendation system for optimising drilling parameters.

Jupiter notebook with code and comments in Russian and English. Created a model for predicting drilling speed in sections with different bit diameters and geology. Source dataset with well data from the Volve field. 
Finally, possible steps to improve the model are described.
